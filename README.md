# simple-calculator
In this program, you'll learn to make a simple calculator using switch case in Java. This calculator program would be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
    
    
    Approach Used:

1.Take two numbers using the Scanner class. 
2.The switch case branching is used to execute a particular section.
3.Using a switch case method to evaluate respective operations.

Algorithm :

1.		Begin 
2.		Print "Enter your choice" 
3.		Enter your choice 
4.		Enter two operands 
5.		If the user enters + or - or * or / then follow the below steps 
		else flow goes to default case & exit the program 
6.		Switch(operator) :
    a.	case +: 
		i.		Print ‘Addition’. 
		ii.		Print result of summation. 
		iii.		break 
    b.	case -: 
		i.		Print ‘Subtraction’. 
		ii.		Print result of substraction. 
		iii.		break 
    c.	case *: 
		i.		Print ‘Multiplication’. 
		ii.		Print result of multiplication. 
		iii.		break 
    d.	case /: 
		i.		Print ‘Division’. 
		ii.		Print result of division. 
		iii.		break 
	e.	default: 
		i.	Print ‘Invalid Option’.
