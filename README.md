# simple-calculator
In this program, you'll learn to make a simple calculator using switch case in Java. This calculator program would be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
    
    
    Approach Used:

1.Take two numbers using the Scanner class. 
2.The switch case branching is used to execute a particular section.
3.Using a switch case method to evaluate respective operations.

Algorithm :
1.  first create  a class name 
2.  import the scanner fuction as it uses to obtain inputs like double,integer etc ..
3.  declare the  class as public so that it can be accessed anywhere.
4.  declare the variables in double so that it can in integer/double form
5.  create an object for the scanner class,so that it can show on the output
6.  initialize the double variable 
7.  enter the  operators which is going to perform 
8.    If the user enters + or - or * or / then follow the below steps 
		else flow goes to default case & exit the program 
		Switch(operator) :
    a.	case +: 
		i.		Print ‘Addition’. 
		ii.		Print result of summation. 
		iii.		break 
    b.	case -: 
		i.		Print ‘Subtraction’. 
		ii.		Print result of substraction. 
		iii.		break 
    c.	case *: 
		i.		Print ‘Multiplication’. 
		ii.		Print result of multiplication. 
		iii.		break 
    d.	case /: 
		i.		Print ‘Division’. 
		ii.		Print result of division. 
		iii.		break 
	e.	default: 
		i.	Print ‘Invalid Option’.
